Rcarpooling is a web application that everyone can use to realize
a car-pooling service.
Essentially people can:
  - Offer their car, specifying where they departure and when, and
    where they want arrive;
  - Ask for a passage, specifying where they departure and where
    they want arrive, the minimum departure time and the latest
    arrival time;

People can departure and arrive in a predetermined set of places:
for each pair you can specify the distance and the travel duration,
either by car and on foot.
The feedback from the system to a requester is:
  - A list of passengers for a driver;
  - A solution (if ever) for a traveller, composed of
    - Eventually, "a branch" on foot;
    - A trip on someone's car;
    - Eventually, another "branch" on foot;

Rcarpooling implements a web-service. It responds to HTTP requests
serving xml and json.
Rcarpooling can interact with human users with e-mail but probably
you will need a "html oriented" web application to talk to users'
browsers.
